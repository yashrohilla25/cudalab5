# cudalab5
This is lab  assignment 5 of parallel and distriuted computing systems
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of vector addition using CUDA C++, focusing on understanding:

- Statically defined global variables in device memory
- Kernel execution timing
- Device property queries (for theoretical memory bandwidth)
- Measured vs. theoretical memory bandwidth comparison
- Profiling with `nvprof`
